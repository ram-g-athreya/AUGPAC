This is a Chrome Extension created for Automatically displaying the GPA in an Anna University Result Page.
Calculating the GPA when results come is a tedious process also the result page in Anna University no longer shows the
credit for each subject, so this process becomes even harder. The idea I had in creating this extension was to show the 
result as soon as the page is loaded so that knowing your GPA would be an effortless process.
